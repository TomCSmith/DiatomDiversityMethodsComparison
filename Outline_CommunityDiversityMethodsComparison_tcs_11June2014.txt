\section{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We are both interested in describing how communities differ in composition and relative abundance...
\item ...in general, and with respect to disturbances like species invasions or extinctions.
\item There are several ways to do this:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item multivariate statistical descriptions and measurements of similarity/distance of whole communities, which taxa are associated with communities clustered together vs. apart; and what covariates and factors differ between clusters.
 \item bivariate methods examining the SAD of communities, and how the parameters of those ddistributions vary for communities under different conditions
 \item univariate methods of richness, evenness, diversity, and alpha/beta/gamma diversity, and how those correlate to environmental covariates and disturbances
 \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Objective}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We would like to compare the information these three 'methods' provide for the same data set.
\end{enumerate}
